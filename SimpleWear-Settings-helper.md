NOTE: As of Android 10 (or Q), non-system apps are no longer allowed to toggle Wi-Fi on or off. This helper app is needed in order to allow SimpleWear to toggle Wi-Fi. The helper app is built for an older version of Android which allows it to be able to toggle Wi-Fi.

**SimpleWear**, on its own, is unable to change system settings like mobile data and location. 
In order to change these settings, the app requires the **WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS** permission. This has to be enabled manually by the user and cannot be requested/enabled within the app.

If you are using Android 10 and above, and want to toggle **Wi-Fi** settings or are on any Android version and want to toggle **location and mobile data**, the **SimpleWear Settings** helper app is needed.

The download link is available below. Please follow the instructions in app after installing to get started.
